			This project was definitely more complicated than I had initially thought, which was complicated to begin with. Along with HTML and CSS for page structure and styling, I used the Django python framework. This helped me to create a database to store images, as well as the post like structure on the homepage. It works like a file folder for information. This framework has been used on Instagram and YouTube to great success, and is surprisingly easy once you learn the basics but requires some python programming language knowledge. Another source I used was CSS bootstrap, it is used to create the navigation bar on the top as well as the styles for the post sections. Bootstrap is like a mixed bag of preset design styles than can be mixed and matched, as well as the code to make it all work together. Beginning the project was comfortable using basic HTML and CSS, until I realized how much I would have to create line by line. The HTML and CSS is relatively easy to learn the basics of, but the frameworks and then deploying the site using Pythonanywhere was a lot more complicated. Most of my time was spent learning these things.

Website design was something that I had never put much thought into before, and quickly learned that it’s a deep rabbit hole to get into. Finding a color palette at first was, and still is difficult. Figuring out placement and margins between text was a bit easier though. Through research, I found that web design is truly an art form in itself. Getting things to look good on screen is tricky, and I cant quite figure it out yet. There is a reason why design teams exist for large scale websites separate from development and database operations. Using Django, I could focus more on this aspect if I didn’t have to learn how to use it as well, but it did free up a lot of integration work. This project was truly a crash course on full web development for me. It’s something that is worth another try with my new knowledge and comfort level.

As I enjoy writing research essays, finding the necessary information was painless. A lot of time went to fixing bugs and weird styling issues where text and boxes would overlap or not display correctly. It still has a few problems that I couldn’t quite figure out and could spend days of time working on. Every bug fix was a small victory towards completing the project, then there would be a new challenge to work through. I didn’t know exactly where to finish, but as I worked, I formed a functioning basic site. After a while I had decided on a final state, as I tend to keep adding things more complicated in my past projects that sometimes go unfinished because of it. I did have some of the skills needed to help me move along. Already knowing some Python programming language helped a lot with Django, but some of it was specific to the framework. Deploying the website was completely unknown to me. I had no idea how without hosting on my own computer and leaving it running 24/7. Luckily Pythonanywhere has a free option to host python projects and was fairly easy to set up with clear and concise documentation. This method uses a virtual environment to run a server for it, similar to Outlook 365 for storage or Netflix for streaming.

These challenges helped my confidence grow throughout the project, with some hiccups of course. A few times I had thought that I made a mistake deciding on this idea but kept trying anyways. Luckily the documentation for everything was easily readable, and learning some of the specifics of how websites work allowed me to get some sort of a design plan made up. I knew I wanted to do a blog format, but was unsure in how to incorporate everything into it. I decided that our class discussions could be used as posts while the other projects and this reflection allowed me to work on the multiple pages aspect with a navigation bar. I didn’t fully know how hard this was going to be or if I could finish in time, but I just barely did. Diving into this project was a fantastic way to learn even if it was stressful to do so on a time limit and for a major grade. It brought out a lot of my weak knowledge points and forced me to adapt around them to grow. Overall it was extremely satisfying to finish something like this with the skills to improve for the next project.
