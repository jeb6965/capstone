			<h>1. Ordinary World</h>
			<p>
			My world as of now mostly consists of school, work, and personal responsibility. Occasionally video games get a chance in there. School has been an on and off factor in my life before coming to CFCC, but there always has been home maintenance and a job to maintain. My priorities currently are to make enough money to pay the bills and take care of what my mom can not do. Pursuing a degree is a long term goal of mine that takes a higher priority to many other things due to time constraints and immediate work load. I spend the most time with my coworkers, but in my personal life its my mom, boyfriend, and best friend.
			</p>
			<h>2. Call To Adventure</h>
			<p>
			My career path is a bit vague, but I am very curious about Cybersecurity. There are many ways to proceed, and many types of careers within. Its something that I’m still exploring right now, and it seems to really invoke a sense of curiosity. I think that the nature of security work is interesting, and even the potentially dull moments would serve a greater overall sense of fulfillment. The consistent learning required for this career is something I already enjoy doing. Everything that I do, I try to continuously learn new and different ways to complete the tasks. Jobs that are incredibly repetitive task to task are very boring and exhausting to me. Data breaches specifically can be catastrophic, and working in security would be a great way to promote safety throughout the world for people who trust governments and companies with securely storing their sensitive information.
			</p>
			<h>3. Refusal Of The Call</h>
			<p>
			I have had many obstacles even up to this point, the largest one being self doubt. In the fall of 2018 I was academically dismissed from UNCW with a 1.8 GPA. I had failed every course that semester due to my own lack of motivation along with many lifestyle and financial struggles. My mother also lost her job and was unable to find another, so I had to sacrifice my school focus for even more overtime at work. To top it all off, I had gotten mono the week of finals and didn’t show up for any of them. Failure was already solidified and I had already given up. Time has always been a limitation, but I think that when used effectively it becomes less so. I do find myself wanting more time for recreational activity, but it isn't the worst limitation. This is where the doubts about the career come from. I fear that I wouldn't be able to handle the level of knowledge and skill required to even make it into the field. Self doubt has been the biggest killer of motivation and peace of mind, but slowly I am trying to i			mprove my outlook.
			</p>
			<h>4. Meeting The Mentor</h>
			<p>
			While I do not currently have a specific mentor, I try to take guidance from everyone that I meet. Usually its older coworkers that have advice on specific life events or just general topics of discussion. One thing that amazes me through improvement on social confidence is the lessons you can learn from almost anyone. Patience is the biggest quality that I look for in mentors and educators. I learn greatly through experience, and that leads to a lot of mistakes. Another quality would be a positive, but realistic outlook on life. Promoting a positive mindset is essential for self growth and motivation. I hope to meet a mentor, or mentors, that can push me outside of my comfort zone while giving me the knowledge to succeed not only in work but in life too.
			</p>
			<h>5. Crossing The Threshold</h>
			<p>
			Personally the call to adventure began through my own decision. Stuck in a dead end retail job where the only positive movement was into management. I was set to take an hourly manager position that I knew I would hate, then made the decision to take a chance and change jobs while returning to school. I was burnt out on retail and low pay for the work being done. I was never ready for it in the sense of being confident and prepared, I just did it. That’s how I feel about entering my field after college, I don’t think I’ll be ready but I’ll go for it anyways. Being an adult to me is understanding this feeling and how it relates to movements in life. Knowing your responsibilities, with a sense of what is important and what is not can make someone a “grown-up”. I do consider myself to be a “grown-up” begrudgingly. Id rather just go back to being a kid without responsibility and stress, but that's impossible. Being an adult, I have some level of freedom and choice which is nice, but the other side of the coin 			are the limitations brought on by responsibility and my own choices.
			</p>
			<h>6. Tests, Allies, Enemies</h>
			<p>
			The largest challenge I would face after college is developing my career. There are many paths I can take, with none of them being the definitive answer. My own indecision is a whole other challenge. Making connections and getting through new-grad interviews will be stressful. From what I can see now, I will be unable to relocate for awhile and this narrows the options greatly but it is manageable. Once in my field, I need to keep up my knowledge in a fast moving world while constantly learning new techniques. Hopefully I will have more free time without homework but it must be spent more wisely than I do now. I don’t think my priorities will change much, but I won’t know until I get there.
			</p>
			<h>7. Approach To The Inmost Cave</h>
			<p>
			My reluctance to get out of my comfort zone must change to push forward. I have already been improving on this but there is a lot of work to be done with it. Procrastination is the biggest issue I face now and I will face in the future. Finishing up my degree and being competitive in the workforce requires a lot of proactive work. A lot of it is putting off work that I don’t want to do but need to. My financial habits have been slowly improving, and to make it through college and into a career they need to keep improving.
			</p>
			<h>8. Ordeal</h>
			<p>
			My fear of the unknown is something that can hold me back from success and needs to be dealt with. I have always leaned towards the “safer” option out of this fear. Sometimes its justifiable, but a lot of the times it comes from wanting to be comfortable.
			</p>
			<h>9. Reward (Seizing The Sword)</h>
			<p>
			To continue through my journey of life, it will require a lot of hard effort. Making through to the other side of my life path, a new one will begin for later in life with a greater level of discipline and self regulation. Maintaining a positive and fluid outlook on life will be something to strive for at that point. Helping to provide stability, financial and emotional for myself and the ones I love is important to me. I hope that reaching my life and career goals, I can introduce that into my life. Through all of the ups and downs, living a good life is important to me even if it could change my career trajectory. Changing for the things you love could limit certain “on-call” jobs since they can be detrimental to a stable and healthy home life.
			</p>
			<h>10. The Road Back</h>
			<p>
			My return to the “Ordinary World” would bring newfound knowledge and skills, along with a positive change in perspective. Confidence built through reaching my goal is motivating for the future ahead. Adjusting to a new environment would be a challenge as lifestyle changes are hard to progress. The world is a wide expanse of knowledge and sadness, and one thing that would never change is my care for others. Getting out of my shell and taking in all there is to experience is something that will change. Timidity will be left behind for a more bold and adventurous me.
			</p>
			<h>11. Resurrection</h>
			<p>
			While the personal success is great, my life path aims to inspire and help others as well. Living in the modern world, security is incredibly important for the protection of other peoples sensitive information. Issues and attacks in these systems can unjustly ruin lives for the average person. My life path is also centered around spreading kindness and help to everyone that I meet regardless of how. Anything I can reasonably do for someone, I will to my best ability. I strive for more stability in my own life, as well as helping others move towards their own version of stability whether it be financial or emotional. The motivation towards care is bigger than myself, and it is also something I hope to instill in others that I may meet along the way. Care for others is a value that looks outward from the self and into the surroundings.
			</p>
			<h>12. Return With The Elixr</h>
			<p>
			The final reward would be the satisfaction from a life well spent. Living a good life is the only thing I can be certain about, and it is the overall goal of my life. If anything, the good life is my main motivator day in and day out. The changes felt on my journey would be a net positive through the learning experiences. There are good and bad changes, but they are all tools for improvement over yesterday. The best piece of advice is to stop worrying so much over the future because it is never going to be certain. All you can do is make the next day better than the last.
